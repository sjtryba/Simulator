# Simulator
A simulator for NASA's Space Launch System

## Panels
6 panels make up the hardware of the user interface.

### Attitude Indicator
The attitude indicator is a que ball marked with latitude and longitude. Three omni-wheels mounted to continuous rotation servos control all three rotational degrees of freedom.

### Joystick and Throttle
A three axis joystick controls the attitude indicator. The throttle is a touch sensitive potentiometer. This panel also has buttons for RCS and SAS.

### Alarm Display
The alarm display shows the pilot anything that is going wrong.

### Alarm Puzzle
The alarm puzzle must be solved if the master alarm is triggered. If you take too long the ship will catch fire and eventually explode.

### Fuel Indicator
The fuel indicator shows the pilot the current levels of fuel and oxidizer for the current stage.

### Life Support Indicator
The life support indicator shows the oxygen, carbon dioxide, and water levels as well as the cabin pressure.
